        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Met all requirements:</strong> I was able to implement all of the basic requirements of the assignment. (Responsiveness, Error handling, All functionalities, etc)</li>
            <li><strong>Attempted to go above and beyond:</strong> I completed all of the optional challenges and also added a "Dark Mode" toggle button, I also added a simple derivative calculator</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>What Could've Gone Better</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The dark mode feature:</strong> The mode feature works well on the two calculator pages but I didn't have the time or expertise to create a global dark mode. The dark mode buttons are local to the page, one thing I would change about this project would be to make the dark mode global.</li>
            <li><strong>The derivative calculator output format:</strong> The output of the format is a little unattractive and hard to read. Here is an example for how it looks: input: (5n^9)-(5/3n^5) output: 45 * n ^ 8 + n ^ 4 * -25 / 3. If I had more time, I would make the output look more humanly written</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS manipulation with JavaScript/DOM :</strong> I learned a lot about how websites use JavaScript/DOM to interact with webpages. From Event Listeners to creating, deleting, and manipulating HTML elements and their CSS styling.</li>
            <li><strong>Hamburger button for the nav bar:</strong> I learned how to create a hamburger button nav bar using entirely CSS, prior to this assignment I used images with a transparent background for the hamburger button nav bars.</li>
            <li><strong>position: fixed:</strong> I learned that when an element is set to position: fixed, it is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it no longer affects or is affected by the layout of other elements. I discovered this when I tried to add a margin to an element, expecting it to create space between the element and a fixed-position element. Instead, the margin was applied relative to the element that came before the fixed element, not the fixed one.</li>
        </ul>
