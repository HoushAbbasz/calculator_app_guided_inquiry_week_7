This is project features a four function calculator. 

The calulator has the ability to add, subtract, divide, and multiply, while handling errors such as 'Divide by Zero' errors. The calculator also has the standard M+, M-, MR, and MC functionalities implemented. In addition, the calculator also logs the User's input and allows the User to recall their previous calculations. The User can also clear their history should they choose. Lastly, the calculator features a dark mode that provides the User with an additional option should they prefer it.

In addition to the four function calculator, I also added a basic calculus derivative calculator using the math.js library as a way to challenge myself and also go above and beyond the scope of the project. 

The derivative calculator allows the User to calculate a derivative with respect to n. The calculator allows the User to create a differentiable function in terms of n using parenthesis, sine, cosine, exponents, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, while error handling. Lastly, this calculator also features a dark mode like the four function calculator. 


HOW TO USE (four function calculator):

Basic Operations:
Addition: Input the first number, click the + button, input the second number and click the = button.
Subtraction: Input the first number, click the - button, input the second number and click the = button.
Multiplication: Input the first number, click the x button, input the second number and click the = button.
Division: Input the first number, click the ÷ button, input the second number and click the = button.
(If you attempt to divide by zero)
Clear: If you feel the need to erase your input, click the 'C' button

Memory Functions:
M+: Adds the current value to memory.
M-: Subtracts the current value from memory.
MR: Recalls the value stored in memory.
MC: Clears the memory.

History Log:
Your previous calculations are automatically logged in the app. You can view your calculation history by clicking the 'Check History' button.
If you want to clear the history, click the 'Clear History' button.

Dark Mode:
Toggle between light and dark mode by clicking the 'Dark Mode' or 'Light Mode' Button.

HOW TO USE (derivative calculator):

Calculating a Derivative:
Input a differentiable expression in terms of n by using an allowable combinations of the 'n', +, -, ^, x, ÷, 'sin', 'cos', and parenthesis. 
Example input: 4n^5 Example output: 20*n^4
Example input2: (5n^9)-(5/3n^5) Example output2: 45 * n ^ 8 + n ^ 4 * -25 / 3
Clear: If you feel the need to erase your expression click the 'C' button

Dark Mode:
Toggle between light and dark mode by clicking the 'Dark Mode' or 'Light Mode' Button.
